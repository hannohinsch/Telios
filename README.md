# Telios
Telios was (is) a commercial asynchronous communications app, written in the early 1980's for the IBM PC (ie, MS-DOS).

Written in MASM 8088 assembly language. Peruse and repurpose to your heart's content.

**History**

In 1982 the Internet was a university consortium kind of thing inaccessable to the public, and HTTP/HTML did not exist at all. However, personal computer owners could connect to various commercial services, "bulletin boards", and corporate computers over the telephone network, using a modem and a terminal emulator app. A number of commercial and freeware programs were available: I believe Crosstalk and PC-Talk led the market.

Telios was my first entrepreneurial effort, written at home on an original IBM PC with 64K of RAM and two floppy drives. Had I been a little smarter I would have written this in C and used assembler only for the interrupt handlers. As it is, this is 100% assembler. A lot of it.

I sold a few hundred copies as it had some features missing from competitor's packages: notably an implementation of Columbia University's Kermit protocol, and a terminal emulation popular at the National Institutes of Health. It was reviewed in the 26 June 1984 and later in the 28 October 1986 issues of PC Magazine (big at the time).

A relic.
