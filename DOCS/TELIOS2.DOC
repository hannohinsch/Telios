Here's a list of features new in Telios version 2.

First off, there's XMODEM support.  It works like this:

PSEND <filename>
Psend sends a file using xmodem.

PCAPTURE <filename>
Pcapture captures a file using the xmodem protocol.

These commands work like CAPTURE and SEND in other respects.
Xmodem transfers are a bit different in one other respect: you
can set the number of retries, and the timeout length (in tenths
of a second) using the RETRIES and TIMEOUT commands,
respectively.

The second major feature is what I call "triggers." A trigger is
a predefined string, just like a function key string, except that
the string is executed if a certain event triggers that string.
The trigger strings are defined using the DEFINE command; the
following triggers are new:

ANSWERBACK triggered by receipt of the ASCII answerback character
RING triggered by modem ring indicator line
CONNECT triggered by a change in carrier signal from OFF to ON
DISCONNECT triggered by a change in carrier signal from ON to OFF
COMMAND triggered by an error in a Telios command
CHAR triggered by a receive error: parity, framing, or overrun error
TIMEOUT triggered (while not using XMODEM) by nothing happening for the
	timeout period
BREAK triggered by receipt of a break signal
PROTOCOL triggered by reaching protocol retry limit

Triggers are incredibly useful in controlling the progress of a
session.  No other communications package has anything like them.

In addition to triggers, there are two new defined strings:
SPREFIX a string that is executed upon starting a file send --
	   useful for starting a mainframe editor, for example
SSUFFIX a string executed after a send has finished -- useful for
	  closing the editor

There's also limited escape sequence support:  I'm going to put
in the stuff that NIH wanted.  You'll be able to use all
available memory for scrolling.

The STORE <filename> command will store the characters in the buffer in
<filename>.

The COLOR <foreground,background,hilite,error-foreground,error-background>
command will change screen color.

The PORT <1 or 2> command will change async ports.
LIST OFF will be default in command files.  The MSG <text>
command displays <text> on the tube, regardless of
the LIST setting.
