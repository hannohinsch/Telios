.CHAPTER Getting Started
.
Telios is a communications program for the IBM Personal Computer.
With the proper hardware (an asynchronous adaptor, modem, and a PC with 
64K memory, DOS, and an eighty column monitor) and this
program, you can use your PC as a terminal and exchange data with other 
computers.  Typical uses
include transferring files to other personal computers, signing on to large
time-sharing computers such as The Source and CompuServe, and getting
the latest news from your local computer bulletin board.

What makes Telios special?
Telios has several features that make it uniquely powerful.  You'll find
that sending files to other computers is easier because of our superior
"throttling" (see discussion of sending files, section 3.2),
you'll like the paging facility that allows
scrolling the screen back and forth, and the command files are
useful for setting up communications options and logging on automatically.
We hope you will find these features as easy to use as they are useful.
.
.SUBJ Making a backup copy
.
Every disk fails eventually, and
the very first thing you should do is make a backup copy of the Telios
disk.  Then store the original in a safe place, and use only the copy.
If you haven't learned how to make a copy of a disk, look up the 
DISKCOPY command in your IBM DOS manual.  It's easy, and having a second
copy of important disks, such as the Telios disk, will save you
much aggravation later on.  Do it.
.
.SUBJ Copyright law
.
Please note that Telios is a copyrighted program.  That means it is 
illegal--a Federal offense, no less--to make copies of this program except
for your archival (backup) purposes.  In other words, you may
not make a copy for use by
someone else, such as your neighbor or colleague.  

We ask that you respect the copyright law.
.
.SUBJ Overview of manual
.
This manual has three important chapters.  "A Guided Tour"
explains how to get started with Telios.  You should read it with a
working computer in front of you.  The next chapter, "How to Do It," is
simply a reference organized by topics of interest.  Skim it to
get an idea of the program's capabilities, then refer back to it when
you need to make use of those capabilities.  If you get stuck, turn to
"Problem Solving," a chapter devoted to just that.  In the back we've
included chapters explaining the various status messages Telios
uses and a table of the ASCII communications code.
.
.
.
.
.CHAPTER A Guided Tour 
.
In this chapter we'll show you how to use Telios and introduce its possibilities.
You won't actually be
communicating with another computer--this is just a warmup exercise--but
you will get an idea of how the program works.  There is no need to 
even turn your modem on.  You'll surely think of questions
while going through this chapter.  That's OK.  The answers, for the most part,
are found in the "How To Do It" chapter.  What we're trying to achieve
is simply getting to the point where you know which questions to ask.  

If you're already familiar with another communications program, or simply
adventurous, feel free to skip this chapter.  You will probably be
able to use Telios
without reading the documentation.
.
.SUBJ First steps
You've made a backup copy of the Telios disk and put the original in a safe
place, right?  No? Then go back and make a copy.  It's important.

Now that you've prepared a working disk,
let's fire up the program.
Telios is started, reasonably enough, by the command "TELIOS."
Try it.  What do you get?  The copyright screen, which once again reminds
you that thou shalt not make copies of this program for other people,
gives you the version number, a pretty circle of stars, and way at the
bottom, the highlighted instruction to "Press the Enter key to continue."
The Enter key is the narrow long one where a typewriter has its Return
key--press
it. The screen clears, and...Welcome to conversation mode.
.
.
.PT Conversation mode
.BODY
Telios works in two modes, conversation mode and command mode.  

What is a mode? It's like an attitude, position, or state of being.
For example, 
one might say people
are sometimes in "sleep mode" and sometimes in "awake mode."
So it is with Telios.

If the program
is in conversation mode, anything you type at the keyboard gets sent to the 
host (The "host" computer is the other computer that you're communicating with;
we'll use "host" interchangeably with "other computer."  The host may in
fact be just another Personal Computer.) That's what you want to do 
most of the time.  Sometimes,
however, you'll just want to tell Telios something without having the other
computer know about it.  That's what command mode is for.  When the program
is in command mode, only the Telios program looks at what you type--nothing
goes to the host.

When the program is in command mode, you can give it a command (about which
more later).  You can tell which mode you're in by looking at the position
of the blinking cursor.  If it's down at the bottom left of the screen, next to
a ">" symbol, you're in command mode.  If the cursor is in the large upper
main part of the screen you're in conversation mode.
Which mode is the program in now?  Do
you see the ">"?  If you don't see the ">" then you must be in conversation
mode.  That's the way it should be.


Notice down there on the right hand bottom part of your screen the message
"Remember: Press F1 for HELP" in black-on-green (reverse-video).
That's a status message, and the place it appears is called,
appropriately enough, the Status area.  Telios will use that area to keep
you informed of all sorts of things.  Anything you see there is a message
from the Telios program, not from the host.  When the other
computer sends something, it appears in the main, upper part of the screen,
not in the Status area.

To sum up: the bottom line of the screen is where you type commands
to Telios, and where Telios puts messages for you (the Status area). The rest
of the screen is used in conversation mode, and you'll see both what you type and
what the host sends displayed up there. (Conversation mode is just
like using an old-fashioned computer terminal.)

Well, the message says "Press F1 for HELP," so go ahead and find the F1 key
and press it.  You could just stay in conversation
mode of course, but we want to take a look at what the HELP key (F1) does.


.PT The Help key (** F1 **)
.BODY
Pressing F1 shows the Help screens.  F1 can be pressed ANYTIME without
ill effect. After reading the information, just press the Enter key
to get back to where you left off.  By the way, all function keys and
commands work even when the Help screens are displayed.
.
.SUBJ The first Help screen (special keys & common commands)
.
So what do we have here?  A list of things we can do--special keys and
some commonly used commands.  There are quite a few additional commands, but
we'll get to those in a minute.  For the moment let's look at the keys:

.ti 5
F1 -- the HELP key
.br
That's the one that got us here, so you know what it does.
.sp
.ti 5
F2 -- move cursor to command line
.br
Find the cursor. What mode (conversation or command) are we in?  Is there
a ">" symbol down there? Yup, we're in command mode.  So the F1 key not
only displayed the Help screen, it also put us in command mode.  The
F2 key just puts you in command mode, without showing the Help screen.  You'll
appreciate it later when you become an expert and don't need help.
.ne 6
.sp
.ti 5
F4 -- suspend/resume character flow to capture file
.br
This key is used in conjunction with the CAPTURE command.
See discussion of downloading in Chapter 3.
.sp
.ti 5
F8 -- the Break key
.br
A "Break" or "Attention" signal is a special signal required by some host 
computers
for various purposes. Pressing F8 sends a break, should you need one.
.sp
.ti 5
F10 -- the Panic key
.br
The Panic function of this key is simple: it stops things.
Specifically, it stops a TYPE command and a SEND command.  It also clears
various "waits" that occur during file transfer.  Generally, the Panic button
should be pushed if Telios is doing something you wish it wouldn't, and you
don't know how else to stop it (that's when panic sets in, right?).
.sp
.ti 5
PgUp -- roll the screen back one page
.ti 5
PgDn -- roll the screen forward one page
.ti 5
Home -- roll the screen back to the first page
.ti 5
End -- roll the screen forward to the last page
.ti 5
Uparrow -- roll the screen back one line
.ti 5
Downarrow -- roll the screen forward one line
.ti 5
Ctrl-Home -- clear the screen buffer
.br
These keys do something pretty neat: when you're in conversation mode (not now)
they'll let you get back the lines that rolled off the top of the screen, and
move back and forth through everything you've seen.  We'll demonstrate that
later on.
.sp
.ti 5
Shift-PrtSc -- send current screen to printer
.ti 5
Ctrl-PrtSc -- toggle character flow to printer
.br
These two keys control the flow of characters to your printer.  If you don't
have a printer, then don't worry about them.  But if you do, you can use
Shift-PrtSc (the PrtSc key is on the right, under Enter) to send everything on the
screen to the printer.  Pressing Ctrl-PrtSc, on the other hand, turns the
printer on and sends all characters that Telios gets in conversation mode 
(from you and the other
computer) to the printer. Pressing Ctrl-PrtSc again turns the printer off.
Press it again; it's on. Et cetera.
.sp
.ti 5
Ins -- send ASCII linefeed (10) character 
.ti 5
Del -- send ASCII delete (127) character
.br
These two keys aren't mentioned on the Help screen, but you should know
about them nevertheless.
Sometimes you'll need to send a Linefeed or a Delete character to the other
computer.  The IBM PC doesn't have a convenient Linefeed key, so we made
the one labeled Ins (next to Caps Lock) serve the purpose. The Del key 
next to it sends an ASCII Del character. 


Now what about the commands on the screen?
You'll see a quick reminder of the functions of F?, DIAL and
QUIT on the screen. You can assign character strings or special functions
(like the Panic function) to the Function keys F3 to F10.  You can also
redefine the meaning of the Backspace and the Enter key.  The F? command
lists the string associated with each key.  The DIAL command sends
three strings, one after the other, to the modem.  If the strings are
set up right, and you're using an intelligent modem, that command will dial
a phone number.  This is discussed in detail in Chapter 3, in the
"Modem control" section.
The QUIT command returns you to 
the operating system. The final line serves to remind that Telios can read 
commands from a file, as well as from
the keyboard.  To execute a command file, type in the name of the file as
if it were a command. 

Time to get on to the second Help screen.  Press F1 again...
.
.
.
.
.SUBJ The second Help screen (** status **)
.
Welcome to the Status screen. Here you see a complete picture of what's
happening. The top two lines tell you if you're capturing to file and
whether data is being routed to the printer.  The second group shows how
the communications options are set, and the third tells you how
the file sending throttles are set.  You can change these settings
with various commands, all of which are covered in Chapter 3, the how-to
chapter.

But there's more, so press F1 again...

.SUBJ The third Help screen (files; downloading; uploading)
.
Here we have some more commands, and you're probably familiar with the
first batch. Their
purpose is to help you manage your disk files; Telios DIR, TYPE, and ERASE
commands work just like their DOS counterparts. DIR lists the files on
your disk, TYPE displays the contents of a file, and ERASE erases.


CAPTURE is used to capture characters to a disk file.
When you want to try that (not now, please) read the section on downloading.
CLOSE is also explained in that section.
ROUTE allows you to selectively capture some characters (what you type at
the keyboard, for example) and ignore others.  Use PROTOCOL to tell Telios
whether or not the Xon/Xoff protocol should be used.

SEND is used
to send the text in a disk file to the host.
Telios sends the contents of the file just
as if you were a (rather fast) typist.  You'll need to read the section on
uploading files before giving it a try. TCHAR and TWAIT are two commands
that control the "throttle";  they control the speed with which Telios sends
lines to the host.

All this talk of commands and you haven't used a one.  What mode
are we in?
The cursor is by the ">", and that means
command mode. Remember when you get Help by pressing F1, you also switch from 
conversation mode to command mode.
So let's try one, ignoring (for the moment) what it does.

Type
.sp
.ce
PROTOCOL obey
.sp
and press Enter.  There, you've
just executed your first command. Note that the Status area now has a message
confirming that the command worked.  Now type 
.sp
.ce
PROTOCOL foo
.sp
and press Enter.
You'll notice, if you look up the PROTOCOL command on the Help screen, 
that "obey" is an allowed
option, but "foo" is not.
The status message,
reasonably enough, now tells you that it didn't work.  You heard the beep, and
when you hear the beep Telios is alerting you to something important
(like a bad command).  By the way, there's no need to type commands
in upper case.  That's just a convention we use in this manual to help you
identify commands. They're always printed in upper case, but you can type them
any way you want.  You can even abbreviate them to the first two letters.
One last point: type 
.sp
.ce
PROT foo
.sp
again, then press the large backspace key (the
one at the upper right). It deletes the last character you typed, allowing
corrections.  Make it PROT OFF, then press Enter when it's right.

Great. Press F1 again and we'll
cover the fourth (and last) Help screen.

.SUBJ The fourth Help screen (function keys; comm. setup)
.
Now here's another screen full of commands. 

The DEFINE command assigns character strings to function keys and
also to the DIAL strings.  If, for example, you wanted key F8 to print
the file directory, you could...
.sp
.nf
.ce
DEFINE 8 ^^2DIR^^M
.fi
.sp
Let's go over that.  You already recognize the DIR in the middle.  The 
^^2 and ^^M
are examples of "escape sequences," groups of characters that
represent special functions.  There is an escape sequence for each
of the 32 unprintable ASCII control characters, plus a couple of special ones.
^^2 is the escape sequence for command mode; it's just like pressing the F2
key. ^^M is the escape sequence for ASCII 13, also known as control-M, also
known as carriage return.  It's the familiar Enter key. There's a list
of escape sequences in Chapter 3.

DEFINE is also used to set up strings for the DIAL command.  The DIAL command
sends three strings, one after the other, to the modem.

The second group sets the communications parameters.
For a discussion of
setting the communication parameters, see Chapter 3.

The Help screens are
reminders, not tutorials, and this tour is just an introduction.
Ok, now you've seen it all. Return to conversation mode by just pressing
the Enter key.  You can always leave command mode by pressing Enter.
.
.
.SUBJ The command mode key (** F2 **) 
If you know which command you need, don't bother with F1 and the Help screen.
Press F2 instead, and zip directly into command mode. Try it once.

Press Enter and you're
back in conversation
mode. Simple.
.
.SUBJ Paging
Now for the promised demonstration of the "paging" facility.  First,
let's type a file onto the screen.  
Press F2 (command mode again), type 
.sp
.ce
TYPE text
.sp
(display contents of file
named "text"), and press return.  Telios displays the file.  Note the "End of
file" message, indicating that the TYPE command has finished.

Now that you're back in conversation mode, type
.sp
.ce
This is the end.
.sp
This gives us a handy reference point at the end of the text.

Now let's page through the screens.  Push the Home key (numeric keypad key 7). 
The beginning of the session
shows. Press PgDn. Press the Uparrow key; try Downarrow,
PgUp, and End. Play around as long as you wish. Finally, type
.sp
.ce
Enough
.sp
Notice how the screen
rolled forward just past the line where you typed "This is the end"?  
You can't mess with the
stuff on the screen; anything you type goes to the end. 

Now press Ctrl-Home.
All clear--that erased everything in the 
screen buffer.  A useful feature if there is
something on the screen--like a secret password--that no one else should see.

The screen buffer (memory) is limited in size, so after a while pressing the 
Home key rolls
back to the first 
.ul
available
screen, which isn't necessarily the very first
one you saw.  The buffer has room for about 20,000 characters.
.SUBJ QUIT (return to DOS)
Although you've seen this command before (and we don't want you to leave now),
you should know more about the QUIT
command....

The QUIT commands returns you to DOS.  Telios will not disconnect the phone line,
or drop the "Data Terminal Ready" signal when you quit.  This means that it
is possible to leave and then return to Telios without disconnecting from
the host.  Should you want to disconnect, be sure to hang up the
phone (or tell your modem to disconnect).
.
.SUBJ Connecting to the host computer
.
This has been a "dry run," of course. We never connected to another computer.
Now that you've been introduced to the program, let's outline the steps
necessary to establish real communications.  

Have you connected your modem to the PC? Or is the host directly attached?
If not, and you need help, read the discussion of modems and cables in Chapter
3.  Come back when you're done.

The next step is starting Telios
(stay in conversation mode).

Now you need to set the proper communications parameters, or at the very least
the right baud rate (use the BAUD command).  The parameters are explained in
Chapter 3.

Assuming you are working with a modem, dial the phone number of the
host computer. With some modems, this means dialing the number by hand, and
then either hanging up or placing the handset in suction cups on the modem.
So-called "intelligent" modems have the capability to dial the number by
themselves.   You'll need to check the instructions.  (Check out the DIAL
command if the modem is intelligent.)

Next, "sign on."  There are a truly bewildering number
of ways to sign on; each system seems to be different.  If you are perplexed or
uncertain,
try to find someone who can give you a hand. 
(A pleasant exception: Many
microcomputer bulletin board systems are self-explanatory. Just dial in and
they provide instructions; you won't need help.)

That's all there is to it.  Remember that everything you type while in
conversation mode is sent to the host.
