Two new commands in version 2x08:

Use the DATA <text or binary> command to select which type of file you're
sending.  Makes a difference in how Telios detects the end of file.  This
used to be a side effect of the filter command, but I think this is better.

The CHATTER <on, off, debug> command controls the style of messages you
get during a protocol transfer. "ON" is the default -- that's a running
count of packet numbers sent/received.	"DEBUG" is mostly for my
purposes, but users may find it useful.


Here's a list of features new in Telios version 2x05.

First off, there's XMODEM and KERMIT support.  It works like this:

PSEND <filename>
Psend sends a file using xmodem/kermit.

PCAPTURE <filename>
Pcapture captures a file using the xmodem/kermit protocol.

These commands work like CAPTURE and SEND in other respects.
Xmodem/kermit transfers are a bit different in one other respect: you
can set the number of retries, and the timeout length (in tenths
of a second) using the RETRIES and TIMEOUT commands,
respectively.

You don't need to change parity or filter when using XMODEM; that's done
automatically (and is also restored upon completion).

You DO need to set parity and filter correctly when using kermit.

Note also the PROTOCOL command, which no longer controls Xon/Xoff signals.
Instead, use it to choose between the XMODEM and KERMIT protocols.
Kermit works like XMODEM, as long as the host understands Kermit, of course.

The FLOW command now sets Xon/Xoff control, and has the same parameters that
PROTOCOL used to have, namely SEND, OBEY, BOTH, or OFF.

Other useful commands:

The COLOR <foreground,background,hilite,error-foreground,error-background>
command sets screen colors.

The PORT <1 or 2> command  changes async ports.

The MSG <text> command displays <text> on the tube, regardless of
the LIST setting.  Useful in command files.

LIST OFF is now the default.  Commands in command files are not displayed
unless you turn LIST ON.

The SCREEN command controls the format of displayed control characters.
If you want to see control characters, set SCREEN GRAPHIC; SCREEN MUTE
turns display off--useful when transferring binary files which tend to look
like garbage. SCREEN NORMAL (the default) restores everything.

If you have either (or both) TWAIT or TCHAR set, then the WAIT
command triggers a wait, just like sending a carriage return.  This
is useful when you want to delay execution of the next command in a
command file, but don't want to send a carriage return just now.

 .TLS is now the default file extension for the DO and SAVE commands.  That
means, for example, to execute the file STARTUP.TLS you need to type only
"DO STARTUP" -- the .TLS is assumed.  Similarly, to save STARTUP.TLS you
need only type "SAVE STARTUP". Specifying an extension overrides the default;
specifying the dot (.) without an extension means the file doesn't have an
extension.

Command file execution now stops when an error is encountered.	Useful for
debugging.

If you type a command from the keyboard, and the command doesn't work, then
the command line is not erased.  This gives you a chance to see and correct the
error with minimal effort.

Control characters are ignored in command mode.
