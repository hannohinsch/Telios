.CHAPTER How To Do It
.
.SUBJ Printing
.
.PT Printing the current screen
.BODY
If you want to send the text currently shown on the screen to the printer,
press the PrtSc key while holding down the shift key.  Be forewarned, if
the screen is
changed (new characters are written to it) while being printed,
you may get a worthless, garbled printout.
.
.PT Echoing to the printer
.BODY
Pressing PrtSc while holding the Ctrl key  (Ctrl-PrtSc) will
send all subsequently
shown characters to the printer. Pressing Ctrl-PrtSc again stops the flow
of characters to the printer.  The Status screen (press F1 twice) shows
whether characters are currently being routed to the printer.
If your printer can't keep up with the characters being sent, the extra
characters are temporarily stored in a buffer.  If this buffer fills up,
you'll lose characters. To avoid that, you should either have a fast printer
(faster than your modem) or capture to a file and then print the file instead
of echoing data directly to the printer.  Only if the host supports
the Xon/Xoff protocol can you reliably use a slow printer.  Be sure to
set PROTOCOL SEND to inform Telios that the host computer accepts Xoff/Xon
signals.
.
.PT Printing a file
.BODY
Instead of printing data as you receive it, you may want to first capture
it in a disk file and then print the file.
This is easy.  When you have finished capturing, return to DOS,
press Ctrl-PrtSc, and 
then use the TYPE command to display the file.  To turn off the printer, press
Ctrl-PrtSc once more.
.
.SUBJ Uploading: Sending a file to the host
.
Rather than simply sending text to the host by typing away in
conversation mode, one frequently sends a whole disk file.  There are
some fine points to watch for in order to make this work well.  First of
all, you need to make sure the host is ready to accept the file.
On a large system, this may mean relying on the system's text editor or it
may mean starting a special program designed specifically for transferring
files.  If you're transferring to another PC, it helps if it has some
sort of communications program such as Telios.  Bulletin board systems have
their own set of techniques.

After getting the host ready to accept the file, it is important
not to send too much data too fast.  Most computers, both large and small,
can accept only relatively small chunks at a time.  There are three ways
to "throttle" Telios so it doesn't send data too quickly.  If the other
computer sends a prompt character (or prompt message) whenever it is
ready to receive a line of input, then use the Telios TCHAR command
to wait for that character. (Hint: After getting the host ready to accept
data, look up the "observed tchar" on the Status
screen. Try using that value for the TCHAR command.)
If the host is kind enough to
send an Xoff character whenever it isn't ready, then you need 
only set PROTOCOL OBEY
to force Telios to obey the Xon/Xoff protocol. A third
alternative is to wait a specified length of time after sending
each line, in the hope that the host will be ready for more data
after that time.  The TWAIT command sets the time length.

One can mix these techniques, and that is the recommended approach. In
particular, we suggest first setting TWAIT to a small number (1-5) even if
the other system sends a prompt or uses the Xon/Xoff protocol.
Some experimentation may show that for your system you can reduce
the wait time, or that you don't need to wait at all.
A common setting that works well with many systems is setting TCHAR ^^J (wait
for a linefeed)
and TWAIT 1, although it is sometimes necessary to increase the TWAIT time.

Finally, a caution to those of you who need to send 8-bit data.
Conventional text files containing normal ASCII data only use 7 bits, and that
presents no problem.  But if you send executable (.EXE or .COM) files,
BASIC files, or even some word processor files (e.g., WordStar files), you'll
find that they include 8-bit data.  You
.ul
must
set PARITY OFF and FILTER OFF
in order to successfully send 8-bit data.  Otherwise Telios lops off that
eighth bit. Hint: to find out if a file contains 8-bit data, use the TYPE
command to display it. If you see any garbled text or out of place characters--
if it isn't just
straight, readable text--then the file probably contains 8-bit data.

You should also make sure the host system is prepared to accept 8-bit data.
Most mainframes cannot.
.
.
.PT Xon/Xoff protocol  
.BODY
Many computer systems use the Xon/Xoff protocol to signal when
they are ready to receive data.  An Xoff character is sent when the
computer wants to stop receiving data; an Xon is sent when it is once again
ready to receive.  Telios honors Xoff signals, dutifully waiting for an
Xon, when PROTOCOL OBEY is set.  Should Telios receive an Xoff without a
corresponding Xon,
entering characters at the
keyboard will result in an error message.  You can end this Xon wait by
pressing the Panic (F10) key.
.
.PT SEND  (send file to host computer)
usage: SEND filename  (filename = name of DOS file to send)
.BODY
SEND is used to send (or upload) a file to the
host. 

If the filter is on,
linefeeds are deleted, and  sending stops when an ASCII 26 (DOS end
of file marker) is seen.

If the filter is off, all characters in the file are sent and the end of file
is sensed by the file size, not by the ASCII 26 character.

Pressing the Panic key (F10) stops the sending.
.
.
.PT TCHAR  (set turnaround character)
usage: TCHAR value  (value = ASCII char, or OFF)
default: OFF
.BODY
If a TCHAR value is specified, Telios stops and waits to receive that
character after every subsequent carriage return sent from a file or the XSTRING
command.
This prevents sending data to the host when it isn't ready.  It can also be
used to wait for an autodialing modem to complete its task.  If TCHAR
is set OFF, Telios does not wait for any turnaround character.
See also TWAIT.

Control characters should be specified with the
escape sequences used for DEFINE.

The Status screen (press F1 twice) displays the last character received from
the host.  If the host sends a turnaround character, this "observed" character
is it.

NOTE:  TCHAR does not wait, it simply sets a wait.  Telios will actually 
wait for the
specified character only after it sends a carriage return character.
Make sure you set the TCHAR 
.ul
before
sending the carriage return that is to
trigger it.
.
.PT TWAIT  (set turnaround wait time)
usage: TWAIT time  (time = tenths of a second, 0-255)
default: 0
.BODY
After sending a carriage return from either a file or an XCHAR command,
Telios waits for the line to be quiet (i.e. for no characters to be received)
the specified length of time before sending the next line.
This gives the host computer
time to ready itself for additional data.
Note that if both TCHAR and TWAIT are set, Telios will not start sending
till some time (the TWAIT time) after the TCHAR is received.

NOTE: TWAIT does not wait, it simply sets a wait time.  Telios actually
waits only after sending a subsequent carriage return character. 
Make sure you set the TWAIT 
.ul
before
sending the carriage return that is to
trigger it.

.
.SUBJ Downloading: Capturing data on disk
.
Capturing data to a file is quite straightforward.  Just use the CAPTURE
command to start, then F4 to stop/restart, and CLOSE when you're
finished.  
You can elect to capture only incoming (received) or outgoing (sent) characters
using the ROUTE command.

Note that you have to CLOSE the file before switching diskettes,
and you have to CLOSE before SENDing or TYPEing it.  
The display of the TYPE command,
the Help screens, and the DIR display are not captured.

If you're receiving 8-bit data (explained in 3.2),
then you must set FILTER OFF and PARITY OFF.
.
.PT CAPTURE  (capture data in disk file)
usage: CAPTURE filename  (filename = name of file to capture to)
.BODY
If a capture file is activated with the CAPTURE command, characters subsequently
received are sent to the file.  If the file already exists 
at the time of the command, its previous 
contents are destroyed.

You can suspend the flow of
characters to the file by pressing F4.  A second press of F4 will toggle
the flow back on again, and so forth. A small plus sign (+) in the lower
right hand of the screen, next to the Status area, indicates that characters 
are being captured.  A
minus sign (-) indicates a file is active but not capturing (it has been toggled
off using F4).  No sign means no CAPTURE file is active.  The name
of the active capture file (if there is one) is shown on the Status screen
(press F1 twice).

A subsequent CAPTURE command stops the flow of characters into the currently 
active file
and starts sending
characters to the newly specified file.
.
.
.PT CLOSE (stop data capture)
.BODY
CLOSE stops capturing data. Unlike toggling data flow with the F4 key, using
CLOSE does not allow you to resume data capture to that file.  You should
CLOSE a file before switching disks, or before SENDing or TYPEing it.
.
.PT ROUTE (select characters to capture)
usage: ROUTE source  (source = ALL, SENT, RECEIVED)
default: ALL
.BODY
The ROUTE command allows you to capture only the incoming (received) or
outgoing (sent) characters.  Changing ROUTE doesn't alter the capture
file in any way; it only affects the fate of subsequent characters.
.
.PT PROTOCOL (set Xon/Xoff protocol)
usage: PROTOCOL use  (use = OFF, SEND, OBEY, BOTH)
default: OFF
.BODY
If PROTOCOL OFF is set, Telios will not send Xon/Xoff characters, and ignore
received Xon/Xoff characters. PROTOCOL OBEY forces Telios to
stop sending after reception of an Xoff, until a corresponding Xon is seen.
PROTOCOL SEND should be set only if the host system obeys the protocol.  Telios
will use Xon/Xoff to prevent buffer overflows if PROTOCOL SEND is in effect.
When PROTOCOL BOTH is set, Telios will both obey and send Xon/Xoff.

Telios is fast enough to almost never need
to send an Xoff, unless you're capturing to disk at a baud rate above 2400,
or printing to a slow printer, or go into command mode (F1 or F2) while
receiving data.

If PROTOCOL SEND has been set, Telios will send an Xoff when its internal
buffer is 3/4 full, and send an Xon when its buffer is again less than
1/4 full.
.
.SUBJ Defining your own commands
Any command that isn't recognized is assumed to be the name of a file containing
Telios commands.  Commands in a file should be used the same way
they are used on the command line.  All commands, including the SEND
command, may be used in a file.  Files may be chained (the name of one
command file may appear in another) but not nested.  That is, when the
second file finishes execution, control does not pass back to the first
file. To set up a command file, we recommend the use of a text editor, such
as the EDLIN program supplied with IBM DOS.

One command file is always executed by Telios--when you start the program,
the file STARTUP.TLS is executed.  This provides a convenient way to change
the default settings.

Errors in a command file do not halt execution.  An unrecognized command,
however, will halt execution if a command file by that name cannot be found.

A number of Telios commands are useful only in command files. 
Descriptions follow.
.
.PT SLEEP  (delay execution of following commands)
usage: SLEEP time  (time = tenths of a second, 0-255)
.BODY
SLEEP delays the execution of the next command in a command file.  

One can achieve similar effects with the TCHAR and TWAIT commands.
But unlike TCHAR and TWAIT, which set up the conditions for a future wait, SLEEP
waits the specified time immediately, right when it is executed.
Choose whichever method is appropriate.
.
.PT REMARK  (embed a comment in file)
usage: REMARK comment
.BODY
REMARK ignores the comment and does nothing.  Comments are
useful in command files to remind the reader of the file's purpose
and actions.
.
.PT LIST (control display of commands)
usage: LIST ON or LIST OFF
default: ON
.BODY
If the LIST option is on, Telios displays each command in a command file
as it is executed.  If LIST is off, no commands are displayed.  The setting
does not affect the display of commands entered from the keyboard, nor
does it affect the display of status messages.
.
.PT XSTRING  (send a string of characters)
usage: XSTRING string  (string = characters to be sent)
.BODY
XSTRING sends a string of characters, just as if they had been entered at the
keyboard.  This is most often used to
control an autodial modem from a command file, or automatically
log on to another system.  Note that no carriage return is sent at the
end of the string unless explicitly specified.
The string does not have to be enclosed in quote marks or otherwise delimited.

Control characters can be embedded in the character string using the same escape
sequences used with DEFINE.  The most commonly needed escape code 
is ^^M (carriage return).
.
.PT The initialization file: STARTUP.TLS
.BODY
When Telios is first started, it looks for a file named STARTUP.TLS on
the default disk drive.  The file is executed if found.  This is
a convenient method of changing the default communications setup to your
needs.
.
.SUBJ Modem control
.BODY
An intelligent modem, like the Hayes Smartmodem, can be controlled
in several ways.  You can set up command files which whose XSTRINGs 
send modem commands, you can define
function keys, you can exploit the built-in DIAL command, or you can simply type
the modem commands in conversation mode.  The 
DISCONNECT and CONNECT commands are
of more concern to those using a dumb modem.  These two commands turn on (and off)
the "Data Terminal Ready" and "Request To Send" signals.  Turning off the signals
causes these modems to hang up.

When dialing from within a command file, using the Hayes Smartmodem, the 
following sequence works nicely:
.sp
.nf
.nj
	REM set up for wait after dial (^^J = ASCII linefeed)
	TWAIT 2
	TCHAR ^^J
	REM now dial the number
	DIAL 555-1212
	REM the commands to actually sign on would follow...
.fi
.ju
.sp
This sequence will dial the number, wait for the modem to send a linefeed, then
wait for the line to be "quiet" for a tenth of a second before continuing.
Once a number has been DIALed, subsequent DIAL commands don't need to specify
it again--they will reuse the last number.

If you choose this method, remember to reset TCHAR and TWAIT to the 
appropriate values before SENDing a file.
.
.PT DIAL (send dial string to modem)
usage: DIAL number (number is optional telephone number)
.BODY
The DIAL command simply sends the defined prefix, number, and suffix strings
to the modem.  These strings may be defined using the DEFINE command, and the
current definition listed using the F? command.

The default prefix  ("AT DT") and suffix ("^^M") work with the Hayes Smartmodem;
users of other intelligent modems need to change them.

If the optional number is specified with the DIAL command, it becomes the
"number" string.

Since the default strings work with the Smartmodem, those users may simply
.sp
.nf
.nj
	DIAL 000-0000
.ju
.fi
.sp
to connect to the host.  You'll need to correctly specify the
phone number, of course. 
Don't be alarmed if the dial command appears ddoouubblleedd, like that, on the
screen.  It's of no consequence.

Many modems send confirmation messages after
dialing.  These messages, typically "connected" or "no carrier," will also be
displayed on the screen. 
.
.PT CONNECT (turn on DTR and RTS)
usage: CONNECT
.BODY
The asynchronous adaptor's "Data Terminal Ready" and "Request To Send" signals 
are turned on.  This command is needed only after a DISCONNECT--the signals
are automatically turned on when Telios is started.
.
.PT DISCONNECT (turn off DTR and RTS)
usage: DISCONNECT
.BODY
The asynchronous adaptor's "Data Terminal Ready" and "Request To Send" signals 
are turned off.  This command is usually needed only 
for forcing dumb modems to hang up.
.
.
.SUBJ Special keys
.
.PT PgUp+PgDn+Home+End keys
.BODY
Telios remembers the characters that have scrolled off the top of the
screen, and you can redisplay them with a press of the PgUp key.
PgDn moves down a page, Home moves to the first page, and End moves 
to the last page.  The up and down cursor keys move up and down one line.
Typing a character when not on the last page automatically moves you to the end.
Pressing Ctrl-Home clears the screen and the screen memory.
.
.PT Break (** F8 **)
usage: press the F8 key (anytime)
.BODY
Pressing the F8 key sends an "attention" signal to the host computer.
F8 is a redefinable key.
.
.PT Panic (** F10 **)
usage: press the F10 key (anytime)
.BODY
Pressing F10
stops
a file send (if one is in progress), and stops the execution of a command
file (if one is executing). Also stops TYPE command and stops SLEEP.
If Telios is waiting for a turnaround character
or Xon character, pressing F10 clears the wait.  F10 is a redefinable key.
.
.
.PT Function keys
.BODY
The first two function keys (F1 and F2) are the permanently assigned
Help key and Command Mode key. Keys F3 through F10, as well as the Enter
and Backspace keys, can have character strings assigned to them.
These character strings can include escape sequences representing control 
characters and special Telios
functions, such as "enter command mode" and "toggle the cap. file."
.
.PT DEFINE (define function keys; set dial strings)
usage: DEFINE key string
       key = 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, ENTER, BS, PREFIX, NUMBER, SUFFIX
       string = character string
.BODY
The character string is assigned to the key, so that whenever the key
is pressed the string is sent.  The dial strings are sent only by the DIAL
command. Special functions and control characters are specified by embedded
escape sequences.
.ne 30
.nf
.PT Escape sequences for DEFINE, TCHAR, XSTRING

	^^@ = cntrl-2 (0)
	^^[ = cntrl-[ (27)
	^^\ = cntrl-\ (28)
	^^] = cntrl-] (29)
	^^^^ = cntrl-6 (30)
	^^- = cntrl-minus (31)
	^^$ = blank (32)
	^^! = ^^ (real ^^ character)
	^^# = del (127)

	^^A through ^^Z = cntrl-A through cntrl-Z

common control characters:
			^^M = carriage return (13)
			^^J = linefeed (10)
			^^G = bell (7)
			^^H = backspace (8)
			^^I = tab (9)
			^^L = form feed (12)
			^^Q = xon (17)
			^^S = xoff (19)

.fi
.
.SUBJ Setting the communications parameters
.
In order for Telios to communicate with another computer, various
options have to be correctly set, that is, both Telios and the other
computer have to be using the same settings.  Since the proper setup
varies from computer to computer, we can't really give you specific
instructions.
While much of this can be learned by experimentation, it is essential to know
the proper
"baud rate," the speed with which the computers are going to send data.
Both computers must use the same baud rate.
This is just about always either 300 (sort of slow) or 1200 (rather fast)
if you're using a modem.  If the host is connected directly without
a modem, then the baud rate may well be higher.  
Find out the proper 
baud rate.

.PT AUTOLF  (set automatic linefeed control)
usage: AUTOLF ON or AUTOLF OFF
default: OFF
.BODY
If AUTOLF is on, a single carriage return character moves the cursor down one line
and to the left hand margin of the display.  If AUTOLF is off, a carriage return
character just moves the cursor to the left hand margin; a separate linefeed 
character is needed to move to the following line.  The setting does
not affect what is sent to the host, only what appears on the screen.

Remark: If AUTOLF isn't set correctly, you'll find lines writing over one another
or double spaced.  
.
.PT BAUD  (set data transmission rate)
usage: BAUD rate   (rate= 110,150,300,600,1200,2400,4800,or 9600)
default: 300
.BODY
Use the BAUD command to set the line speed (baud rate) of the asynchronous
communications adaptor (the hardware).  The number of stop 
bits is automatically
set by this command,
2 for 110 baud, 1 for all other speeds.

Remark: Setting the line speed does not affect any other
communications parameters, e.g., it won't disconnect the phone line.
If the rate is incorrectly
set, you'll see a burst of errors, especially "Framing Errors," and text
on the screen will be garbled and unintelligible.
.
.PT PARITY  (set parity checking)
usage: PARITY type  (type= EVEN, ODD, MARK, SPACE, or OFF)
default: EVEN
.BODY
The parity command changes the type of parity checking performed.
If parity checking is set OFF, 8 data bits are used; all other
parity settings use 7 data bits.  Be sure to set PARITY OFF if you
transmit or receive binary data, such as executable files.  If a
parity error is detected, a message is displayed.

Remark: The PARITY setting is most often EVEN.  If you get constant 
"Parity Error" messages in
the Status area, play around with other settings until you find one that
doesn't give errors. An occasional error is normal.
.
.PT ECHO  (set local or remote echo)
usage: ECHO ON or ECHO OFF
default: ON
.BODY
If ECHO is on, characters you type are displayed (echoed) on
the screen by Telios. If it is off, the responsibilty for showing the
characters lies with the host computer.  ECHO ON is sometimes called
"half-duplex operation," and ECHO OFF is called "full-duplex operation."

Remark: If ECHO isn't right, characters you type will either
appear twice or not at all.
.
.PT FILTER  (delete control characters)
usage: FILTER ON or FILTER OFF
default: ON
.BODY
The FILTER deletes (filters) received control characters and non-text characters.
If filter is on, then only the ASCII Bel (7), Backspace (8),
Tab (9), Linefeed (10), Form Feed (12),
Carriage return (13), and text characters are displayed
on the screen, printed, and captured.  If the filter is off, all characters
are shown, printed and captured.  In addition, turning the filter off makes
control characters appear on the screen as graphic characters--they do not
have their usual effect (the screen will look like a mess if you turn the
filter off).

Characters typed on the keyboard are not affected by the filter.
If a file is being sent (uploaded), and filter is on, then linefeed characters
are deleted (not sent), to preserve the parallel with a user hitting carriage
return at the keyboard. 

File sending stops when an ASCII 26 character (DOS end
of file marker) is seen in the file, if the filter is on.  The whole file, based
on the file size, is sent when the filter is off.

Remark: You'll want to keep the filter on except when transferring files
containing 8-bit or binary data.  Then turn the filter off, and be sure to set
PARITY OFF as well.
.
.SUBJ Setting up cables and modems
.
Telios works with all IBM compatible asynchronous adaptors and
modems that we know of (including the Hayes Smartmodem(tm)).  We suggest you
use a modem cable that connects pins 2 through 8, and pins 20 and 22.  This 
ensures
compatibility with other modems, and software. This should be a "straight" cable,
that is, the wires should connect each pin with the corresponding pin on the other 
end.  If you are hooking the PC directly to another piece of equipment that is
wired as Data Terminal Equipment (DTE), such as another PC, you'll need a
cable that crosses pins 2 and 3, 4 and 5, 6 and 20.

You do not need to change the factory settings on the Hayes Smartmodem.
.
.SUBJ Managing your disk files
.
.PT DIR (list files)
.BODY
The DIR command, just like its DOS equivalent, lists the names of your disk
files.  You can use the same options as in DOS: no option lists files
on default disk, a drive identifier (e.g. B:) lists files on that drive,
or give it filenames with "*" and "?" characters to list specified files.
The DOS "/P" and "/W" options are not supported.
.
.PT TYPE (type contents of file on screen)
.BODY
TYPE displays the contents of a file on the screen.  You can scroll (page)
through the display, but the displayed characters don't get
sent to the printer, the host, or the capture file.
.
.PT ERASE (erase a file)
.BODY
ERASE erases a file or group of files. Wildcard characters ("*" and "?") may
be used, but Telios will not allow ERASE *.* (you can't erase all files
on a disk with one command).
.
.SUBJ Control characters
.
Telios can send any control character from the keyboard, any function key, XSTRING,
the dial strings.  Control characters in a file are controlled by the filter.

Telios interprets (executes) the Bell (7), Backspace (8), Tab (9),
Linefeed (10), Form Feed (12), and Carriage return (13) control characters.
Tabs are set at every 8 positions; a received Form feed clears the screen. A
sent Form feed clears both the screen and the screen memory.
.
.SUBJ Using commands
.BODY
Telios commands are used to control the communications link, as well as 
send and
capture data.  To execute a command, press F2 to move the cursor to
the command line, then type the command and press the Enter key.
Pressing F1, the Help key, also moves the cursor to the command line.

Telios is in command mode (ready for you to type a command) whenever the ">" symbol appears
in the bottom left of the screen.  You'll also see the "Ready for command"
message at the bottom right.

While in command mode,
the large Backspace key (left pointing arrow at top right of keyboard)
deletes the last character and backs up the cursor.

Telios commands and options can be abbreviated to the first two letters, but
everything you type is checked. "SEND" is not the same as "SEEK," although
the first two letters are the same. The DIAL, DISCONNECT, and DIR commands
can be abbreviated to three or more letters, but not two.

Commands that are not recognized are assumed to be the names of command files
to be executed.

Command lines from the keyboard can be up to 35 characters long.  Lines in
a file may be up to 255 characters long.

When the program appears to be stuck, Telios
is either waiting for an Xon character or a turnaround character to be
sent by the host.  Press the Panic key (F10) if you want to continue.
Be warned that
this will stop any file transfer, although it puts you back in control.
.
.SUBJ Double characters; no characters
.
If typed characters aappeeaarr ttwwiiccee, like that, then set
ECHO OFF.  If they don't appear at all, then set ECHO ON.  If it looks ok,
it is ok.
.
.SUBJ Double spacing; no spacing
.
If lines appear to be double spaced, be sure AUTOLF is off.  If lines are
"no-spaced," i.e., lines are overwriting one another, set AUTOLF on.
.
.SUBJ Losing incoming characters
.
Telios is designed to accept characters at speeds up to 9600 baud, but there
are a couple of ways characters can be lost.  If you are echoing characters
to the printer, and the printer is slower than the modem, you can (after a
while) overflow the internal buffer.  Similarly, the screen can only display
characters at about 4000 baud, so faster speeds may cause the buffer to overflow.
If you're capturing to disk, the same thing can happen.
The general rule of thumb is that characters will never be lost at 2400
baud or less, unless a slow printer is turned on.

At high speeds, you should set PROTOCOL SEND if the host computer supports
the Xon/Xoff protocol.  
If the protocol is in use,
you will never lose characters
--even if the
printer is slow or you're capturing to a file.
We do
not know of any system that uses baud rates over 1200 and
.ul
does not
support Xon/Xoff, so character loss is in fact no more than 
a remote possibility.

.SUBJ Losing characters while uploading
.
The host computer generally can not accept characters as fast as Telios can
send them.  You must, therefore, "throttle" the sending to ensure that
characters are sent only when the host is ready.  The discussion of uploading
in Chapter 3 covers the available methods.
.
.SUBJ Garbled characters
.
If characters are totally unintelligible, come in short spurts (not smoothly),
and are accompanied by framing and parity errors, then 
the baud rate is incoreect.  If you get occasional garbled characters, it's probably
just a bad phone connection.  If you get readable text but lots of other,
graphic characters as well, you probably have the filter turned off.
.
.SUBJ TWAIT or TCHAR not working
.
You are probably setting TCHAR or TWAIT too late.  Remember that these commands
do not actually wait for anything; they simply set up a wait that is 
later triggered by sending a carriage return character.
.
.SUBJ The last resort
.
If it's just too confusing (or doesn't work the way it should), give us a call.

.CHAPTER Status Messages
.ERR Autolf turned on/Autolf turned off
Command confirmation.
.ERR Baud rate set to ...
Command confirmation.
.ERR Break signal received
Telios sensed a break in the communications line.
.ERR Buffer nearly full
The receive buffer is 2/3 full. You are in danger of losing incoming characters.
.ERR Buffer has overflowed
You have definitely lost some incoming characters.  See discussion of problem in
Chapter 4.
.ERR Capture to file started
Data is being sent to disk file.
.ERR Capture to file stopped
Data will no longer be sent to disk file.
.ERR Character overrun detected
A character arrived before the previous one could be read.  In theory, this
should
never happen.  Nevertheless, it does happen when using some print 
spooling programs which are
improperly written.  The print spooler is
disabling interrupts for too long.
.ERR Command option missing
Telios expected more command options.  You're leaving something out.
.ERR Data capture resumed
Data capture is toggled back on.  Characters are going to file.
.ERR Data capture suspended
Data capture toggled off.  No characters are going to file.
.ERR Data error
The data on the disk was unreadable.  The disk is probably bad, but sometimes
one can read it on another drive, sometimes jiggling the disk a bit and reinserting
it clears things up.  Hope you made a backup.
.ERR Disk full
There is no more room on disk.  If a capture file was active, it has been
closed.  Use the DIR and ERASE command to see if there are unneeded files
that you can erase to make more room.
.ERR Disk is write protected
You tried to write on a disk that has a write protect sticker on it.  Check
to make sure you have the right disk, and remove the sticker if necessary.
.ERR Drive not ready
The disk drive door is open. Close it and try again.
.ERR Echo turned on/Echo turned off
Command confirmation.
.ERR End of file
The TYPE or SEND command has reached the end of the file.
.ERR Erased Ok
The specified file was successfully erased.
.ERR Executing command file...
Telios is executing commands from a command file.
.ERR File close failed
DOS was unable to close a file.  Your disk is probably too full. 
.ERR File directory full
You have too many individual files on the disk.  Erase some to make room.
.ERR File not found
The file you specified is not on disk.  Remember that Telios assumes that
any command it doesn't recognize is the name of a command file, so perhaps
you simply mistyped a command name.
.ERR Filter turned on/Filter turned off
Command confirmation.
.ERR Framing error detected
An incoming character was improperly framed.  Ususally, this means you're
using the wrong baud rate.  An occasional framing error (especially when
starting up, or turning the modem off) is no cause for alarm.  However,
the one character that caused the error was probably garbled.
.ERR General disk failure
Your disk is bad.  Try another.
.ERR Global erase not allowed
Telios will not allow you to erase every file on a disk in one fell swoop.
.ERR Incorrect filename
The filename you specifed doesn't follow the DOS rules for a legal filename.
.ERR Incorrect command option
The specified command option (that's everything after the command name) was
not recognized.  Check to make sure you're not mistyping.
.ERR Internal error 
You have discovered a bug.  Write down the full text of the message and
what you did just before you got the message, then contact us so we can
fix the problem.  Thank you.
.ERR Invalid drive specified
You specified a drive identifier for a nonexistent disk drive.
.ERR Line connected
The communications line changed from disconnected to connected.
.ERR Line disconnected
The communications line changed from connected to disconnected.
.ERR No active capture file
You tried to toggle off data flow to file, but there isn't an open capture
file.  Nothing happens.
.ERR Not accepted--waiting for XON
The host computer sent an Xoff character, a signal for Telios to stop sending.
Telios is now waiting for an Xon character.  The character  you 
typed was ignored.
If you want to ignore the Xoff
and send anyway, press the Panic key (F10), then resume typing.
.ERR Obey Xon/Xoff signals from host
An Xoff character from the host will stop Telios from sending until a
corresponding Xon is received.  Telios will not send Xon/Xoff signals to the
host.
.ERR Ok
Command confirmation.  The command worked.
.ERR Parity error detected
An incoming character had an improper parity bit.  This may mean the character
is garbled (not what was sent).  If you get a flurry of these errors, you
are probably using the incorrect parity setting.
.ERR Parity set to .../Parity checking turned off
Command confirmation.
.ERR Printer started
Characters will be echoed to the printer.
.ERR Printer stopped
No characters will be echoed to the printer.
.ERR Ready for command
You just entered command mode.
.ERR Remember: Press F1 for HELP!
Just a reminder.
.ERR Routing all chrs. to file
All characters will be routed to the capture file, if active.
.ERR Routing received chrs. to file
Only characters received from the host will be captured.  Other characters
appear on the screen, but won't be captured.
.ERR Routing sent chrs. to file
Only characters sent to the host will be captured.  Other characters will
appear on screen, but not in the file.
.ERR Seek error
Either your disk or disk drive hardware may be bad.
.ERR Sector not found
Your diskette is bad, or you may be using a double-sided diskette in a 
single-sided drive.
.ERR Sending file...
The SEND command is working.
.ERR Sleeping...
Siesta time. A SLEEP command is executing.
.ERR Turnaround character set
Telios will now wait for that character before sending each line (from file
or XSTRING).
.ERR Turnaround chr. checking stopped
Command confirmation.
.ERR Turnaround wait time set
Command confirmation.  Telios will now wait after sending a carriage return from file
before resuming transmission.
.ERR Too many command options
You specified more command options (more things on the command line) than
Telios expected.  Check that the options are correct, and that you didn't
type any extra spaces.
.ERR Typing file...
The TYPE command is working.
.ERR Unknown command
The specified command was not recognized.  Currently, that means you said
"DI" and Telios didn't know whether you meant DIAL, DISCONNECT, or DIR.
Use at least three letters for the DI... commands.
.ERR Waiting for turnaround chr.
TCHAR is enabled, and Telios just sent a carriage return character from a file
or the XSTRING command.  Telios will now wait for the "turnaround character"
before resuming transmission.
.ERR Write fault
Nasty disk error.  Your disk is probably bad.
.ERR Xoff sent (buffer nearly full)
The buffer was 2/3 full, and Telios sent an Xoff to the host to signal
it to stop sending.
.ERR Xon sent (buffer nearly empty)
The buffer isn't full anymore, and Telios sent an Xon to the host to 
resume transmission.
.ERR Xon/Xoff in use by host+Telios
Telios will obey received Xon/Xoff signals, and send them to prevent
internal buffer overflows, if necessary.
.ERR Xon/Xoff protocol not in use
Telios will not send Xon/Xoff signals, and ignore those received from the host.
.ERR Xon/Xoff sending enabled
Telios will send Xon/Xoff signals to the host to prevent buffer overflow,
if necessary.  Telios 
.ul
is not
obeying received signals.
